            Hello there! My name is Emmy Runge, as I am sure you are somewhat aware of. 
            What you might not know is that I am a senior going for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. 
            But that wasn't always the plan.   When I first started college, my plan was to become an English major. 
            I was gonna be an English teacher for public high school kids and maybe write on the side. 
            But I always felt like there was something missing from that dream. 
            Then my older brother, a self-learning programmer, told me about one of the courses 
            that was being offered my freshmen year. It was Introduction to Programming, a class that 
            showcased what one could do if they knew just little Python. And then I was hooked.   
            <br>
            <br>
            I have a professor who says that you know you're doing it right if you dream about it. 
            Well, I see things in puzzles now. I see how maybe one line of code, written into real everyday life, could fix this issue or 
            how things would fit better together if this was done. And personally? I don't even like puzzles that much. 
            But I like to fix problems, and fit pieces together in a new and interesting way and knowing that I
             am about to enter a field that aspires to help people with their problems by finding
             creative answers which most of the time involve looking anywhere but where the box is, 
             invigorates me to keep pursuing my passion in Computer Science. 
             <br>
             <br>
             I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given and excited for the possibilities that await!
        </p>
